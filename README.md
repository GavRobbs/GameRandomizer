# Game Randomizer

I was reading the Game Design Workshop by Tracy Fullerton. In this book, she dissects the formal elements of games, and mentions that new ideas may come around by mixing and matching the formal elements. I had an old folder of SNES ROMS and I wrote this script to randomly pick the games that I should play next, in order to dissect their formal elements and possibly mix and match the ideas within to fuel my own creativity.

This emulator can work with any rom file format by specifying the relevant command line arguments - type 'gamerandomizer.py --help' or 'gamerandomizer.py -h' in your console for more details.
